        <h1>The UNSDG's and Goal 12:</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals are a collection of 17 connected goals building on the principle of “leaving no one behind”. They were put in place in 2015 and are to be achieved by 2030. They were designed to help achieve a better future for all. The goals cover topics from gender equality to making sustainable cities and communities. One of these goals is titled Responsible Consumtion and Production. This goal is based on targeting consumers and producers trying to have them make better decisions and act better towards our planet and others to make a positive impact.</p>
        <h1>Climate Action Connection to Tennis Balls:</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Retour Tennis, a company dedicated to recycling tennis balls reports over 300 million balls disposed of each year. Less than half a percent of those balls are recycled. These stats show how poorly tennis balls are being consumed, produced and managed. Single tennis tournaments use over 70,000 tennis balls! I believe that if people can start using tennis balls a little bit longer, and buying more eco friendly tennis balls a huge difference can be made.</p>

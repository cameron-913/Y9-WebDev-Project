        <h1>The UNSDG's and Goal 13:</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals are a collection of 17 connected goals building on the principle of “leaving no one behind”. They were put in place in 2015 and are to be achieved by 2030. They were designed to help achieve a better future for all. The goals cover topics from gender equality to making sustainable cities and communities. One of these goals is titled Climate Action. This goal is based on taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. At the moment not enough people are standing up and helping to fight climate change. This goal seeks to address this issue and beat climate change in the battle by 2030. There are also several subsections for this goal.</p>
        <h1>Responsible Consumtpion Connection to Tennis Balls:</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Retour Tennis, a company dedicated to recycling tennis balls reports over 300 million balls disposed of each year. Less than half a percent of those balls are recycled. These tennis balls take 400 years to decompose. They are filled with additives to help the bounce and feel, however those additives leach from the decomposing landfills into nearby water sources contaminating them. Tennis balls are made out of the yellow felt on the outside and a softer rubber inner core. Obtaining these materials is costly. Sheep take up many acres of farmland to obtain the felt and the rubber on the inside comes from natural trees found in the Amazon rainforest which only contributes to more deforestation.</p>

        <p>Several connections can be made between climate action and sustainable production and consumption. With more SCP the more materials can be recycled and the longer they last. This means less natural resources have to be extracted from our environment helping climate action. As well, this means less materials are thrown out limiting the amount of waste placed in landfills.</p>
